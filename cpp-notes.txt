** pointers vs references **

Pointer: A pointer holds the address to a variable. A pointer needs
	to be dereferenced with the * operator to access the variable.

References: Essentially a pointer under the hood. Has automatic 
	indirection, i.e., the compiler will apply the * operator
	for you. Kinda like another name for the variable, i think??


Differences:-

	- Pointers can be reassigned, but not references.
	- Pointers can be initialized in multiple lines, but not
	references.
